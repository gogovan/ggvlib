# GGV Lib (Gogovan Common Utils)
This library is simply for reducing the amount of repetititve code analysts need to write for reading, writing and parsing data as well as interacting with 3rd party APIs.

## Documentation
 * Hosted [here](https://gogovan.github.io/ggvlib/index.html)

## Usage
* This is intended to be used in Gogovan related microservices and adhoc analysis

## Design Principles
* Function and argument names should be descriptive and clear
* Dependencies should be minimal aside from Google API client libraries
* Functions and classes should be generalized and reusable in many situations
